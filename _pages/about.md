## About me
Welcome to my webpage! I'm Anna Liu (刘安娜), but you can call me Ania, the Polish familiar form of my name. I am half-Polish half-Chinese, and I am currently pursuing a PhD in Gravitational-Wave Physics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). I am a member of the [Gravitational-Wave Group at CUHK](https://gw.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/), and a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. Below, you can find more details about my research and education journey.

#### Education: 
- PhD Physics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2021-present
- MSc Astronomy & Astrophysics, KU Leuven, Belgium, 2021
- BA (Hons) Physics, University of Oxford, UK, 2018

#### Research Interest 
- Gravitational waves from binary black holes: data analysis and phenomenology
- Gravitational-wave lensing
- Probing General Relativity with black-hole ringdown
