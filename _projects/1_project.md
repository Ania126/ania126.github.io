This project introduces a novel phenomenological approach to model gravitational-wave millilensing in a model-independent manner. 
By parameterizing lensed gravitational-wave signals with lensing observables, we capture the imprints these observables leave on the signals. 
This method allows us to model arbitrary lensing configurations, as long as there is a single lens along the line of sight, without imposing model-specific restrictions. 
This results in a more physically realistic description. 
The project involves transdimensional sampling, implemented using the Bayesian inference library Bilby.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
