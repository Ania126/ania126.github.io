This project introduces a novel phenomenological approach to model gravitational-wave millilensing in a model-independent manner {% cite liu2023exploring %}. 
By parameterizing lensed gravitational-wave signals with lensing observables, we capture the imprints these observables leave on the signals. 
This method allows us to model arbitrary lensing configurations, as long as there is a single lens along the line of sight, without imposing model-specific restrictions. 
This results in a more physically realistic description. 
The project involves transdimensional sampling, implemented using the Bayesian inference library Bilby.
